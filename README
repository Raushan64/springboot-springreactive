Asynchronous and Non-Blocking
----------------------------------
Traditional:
- Subscriber do not get any record in browser Unless Publisher publish all records i.e Subscriber totally blocked until process all record by Publisher.
- If Subscriber cancel/stop the request from browser then still Publisher publishing the record in background which is not required.

url: GET http://localhost:9191/customers

Reactive:
- Once Publisher publish the record then Subscriber immediately get the record
- If Subscriber cancel/stop the request from browser then immediately Publisher stop publishing the record and Subscriber stop getting the record in browser.

url: GET http://localhost:9191/customers/stream

Note: Browser is Subscriber and Dao-method is Publisher.


Functional Endpoints
----------------------
Tranditional
- As we work, client request in browser then request goes to controller by RequestMaping and controller call to service and Dao.
- Publisher always publish the data in object.

url: GET http://localhost:9191/customers

Reactive
- client request in browser then request goes to router and router route to handler and Dao.

If you are not trying to achieve the stream then Publisher publish the data in object, and this still Synchronous blocking.
url: GET http://localhost:9191/router/customers
     GET http://localhost:9191/customers/{input}

     POST http://localhost:9191/customers/save
     Request Body: {
                     "id": 5,
                     "name": "kumar"
                   }

If you are trying to achieve the stream then in this case Publisher publish the data in stream not an object, and this ASynchronous non-blocking.
url: GET http://localhost:9191/router/customers/stream
